# hello-world
Oh, hello world

##You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

###You want order in Gotham. Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in. Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word.

####And why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?

Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman I'll see him again.

My name is Merely Ducard but I speak for Ra's al Ghul... a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld. A mon who can offer you a path. Someone like you is only here by choice. You have been exploring the criminal fraternity but whatever your original intentions you have to become truly lost. The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil and wishes to serve true justice. The path of the League of Shadows.

I'm not wearing hockey pads.

You hung up your cape and your cowl but you didn't move on. You never went to find a life.

You know what you said about the structures becoming shackles. You were right and I can't take it, the injustice. I mean, no one ever's gonna know who saved the entire city.

This town deserves a better class of criminal and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.

You are in hell, little man. And I am the devil.

Very well. Death! By exile.

To manipulate the fears in others, you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin?

I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. where it hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in?
